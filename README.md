# mockGoogle
-Project was to reverse engineer a replica of the google home-page. Looks only, not functionality.


This was my first from-scratch project, and I feel it helped me understand coding better, and helped me build up some skills along the way.

I did my best to keep a consistant structure. Following the same top-down pattern with my html and css. Css felt like the main objective, and it 
  took a lot of different modifications to get everything right. Changing colors of the text, background, or borders. Aligning items using automatic techniques
  like text-align or justify, or manually with padding or margins. Setting up hover actions, hyperlinks, and buttons. Adding shadows, removing underlines,
  correct width/height, adding images. These are all things that came up multiiple times, and felt pretty natural towards the end.
